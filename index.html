                    <h4>The Neighbourhood
                        <br></b><br>
                        And all I am is a man
                        <br>
                        I want the world in my hands
                        <br>
                        I hate the beach
                        <br>
                        But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
                        <br>
                        Use the sleeves of my sweater
                        <br>
                        Let's have an adventure
                        <br>
                        Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
                        <br>
                        Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
                        <br>
                        You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
                        <br>
                        Oh, she knows what I think about
                        <br>
                        And what I think about
                        <br>
                        One love, two mouths
                        <br>
                        One love, one house
                        <br>
                        No shirt, no blouse
                        <br>
                        Just us, you find out
                        <br>
                        Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
                        <br>
                        'Cause it's too cold
                        <br>
                        For you here
                        <br>
                        And now, so let me hold
                        <br>
                        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
                        <br>
                        And if I may just take your breath away
                        <br>
                        I don't mind if there's not much to say
                        <br>
                        Sometimes the silence guides a mind
                        <br>
                        To move to a place so far away
                        <br>
                        The goosebumps start to raise
                        <br>
                        The minute that my left hand meets your waist
                        <br>
                        And then I watch your face
                        <br>
                        Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
                        <br>
                        These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
                        <br>
                        Inside this place is warm
                        <br>
                        Outside it starts to pour
                        <br>
                        Coming down
                        <br>
                        One love, two mouths
                        <br>
                        One love, one house

                        My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
                        <br>
                        I asked the doctor, "can you find out what is wrong with me?
                        <br>
                        I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet

                        So tell me just what I should do?"

                        I want better discussions, I want someone to care

                        <br>
                        I'm addicted to anything that's not good for me, oh
                        <br>
                        And in spending my time thinking, "who the hell is she in your arms smiling?"
                        <br>
                        I know you're afraid, do what you want, but I've been curious

                        Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind when you're kissing her

                        Oh, it's just jealousy that keeps me up at night
                        <br>
                        When you're runnig through my mind

                        She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
                        <br>
                        She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
                        <br>
                        And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
                        <br>
                        But now she's got a cup with something else in it
                        <br>
                        It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter-past-ten
                        <br>
                        And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
                        <br>
                        She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
                        <br>
                        Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain
                        <br>
                        Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
                        <br>
                        Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
                        <br>
                        And she knows that she shouldn't listen
                        <br>
                        And that she should be with me by the water fountain
                        <br>
                        She couldn't be at home in the night time because
                        <br>
                        It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
                        <br>
                        I was too young
                        <br>
                        I should've built a home with a fountain for us
                        <br>
                        The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
                        <br>
                        I was too young
                        <br>
                        Too young, too young
                        <br>
                        Too young, young
                        <br>
                        And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
                        <br>
                        The handle will be broken and the rust set in
                        <br>
                        But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
                        <br>
                        My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it
                        <br>
                        Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
                        <br>
                        Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
                        <br>
                        And I know that it's only a wish
                        <br>
                        And that we're not standing by the water fountain
                        <br>
                        Too young, too young
                        <br>
                        Too young, young
                        <br>
                        She couldn't be at home in the night time because
                        <br>
                        It made her feel alone but at that time she was too young
                        <br>
                        I was too young
                        <br>
                        I should've built a home with a fountain for us
                        <br>
                        The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
                        <br>
                        I was too young
                        <br>
                        Too young, too young
                        <br>
                        Too young, young
                        <br>
                        I should've built a home with a fountain for us
                        <br>
                        (Too young) the moment that she told me that she was in love
                        <br>
                        (Too young) too young
                        <br>
                        (Young) I was too young

                        We're all bored
                        <br>
                        We're all so tired of everything
                        <br>
                        We wait for trains that just aren't coming
                        <br>
                        We show off our different scarlet letters
                        <br>
                        Trust me, mine is better
                        <br>
                        We're so young
                        <br>
                        But we're on the road to ruin
                        <br>
                        We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doin'
                        <br>
                        We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
                        <br>
                        Honey, life is just a classroom
                        <br>
                        (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

                        We sing it proudly
                        <br>
                        We are too busy dancing
                        <br>
                        To get knocked off our feet

                        We're all here
                        <br>
                        The lights and noise are blinding
                        <br>
                        We hang back
                        <br>
                        It's all in the timing
                        <br>
                        It's poker
                        <br>
                        He can't see it in my face

                        But I'm about to play my Ace (ah)
                        <br>
                        We need love
                        <br>
                        But all we want is danger
                        <br>
                        We team up
                        <br>
                        Then switch sides like a record changer

                        The rumors are terrible and cruel

                        But honey, most of them are true

                        Well, I romanticize and then I get to stressing

                        A big brain like I'm teaching it a lesson
